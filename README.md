Native chat session provider for VS Code that connects external agent CLIs through the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).

## Features

- Registers ACP agents as VS Code chat sessions with automatic discovery and refresh.
- Streams assistant responses and tool outputs directly into the chat UI.
- Executes ACP tool calls, including file and terminal operations, with permission prompts.
  > Currently tool call's output is shown in the Ouput panel "ACP Tool Output".
- Manages ACP sampling sessions, terminal lifecycles, and progress reporting inside VS Code.

## Configuration

Add ACP agents under the `acpClient.agents` setting (User or Workspace) to surface them in the chat session picker:

```json
"acpClient.agents": [
  {
    "id": "cagent",
    "title": "Cagent",
    "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/cagent",
    "args": [
      "acp",
      "/path/to/your/agents/cagent.yaml"
    ]
  }
]
```

Make sure each entry has a unique `id`, includes the CLI `command`, and is enabled (default). Disabled agents are ignored.
